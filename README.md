Description:
GitHub Repository: [Link to Your Repository]

Overview:
Welcome to the "Classification of Mango Quality" project repository! This machine learning project leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify mangoes based on key physical parameters, including weight, length, and circumference. The project assigns a grade to each mango, ranging from 1 to 5, to assist in quality assessment.

Dataset:
This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing measurements of mangoes, including the following attributes:
1. Weight
2. Length
3. Circumference

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that can classify mangoes into different quality grades based on the provided parameters. The assigned grades enable effective quality control and sorting of mangoes in various agricultural and commercial applications.

Methodology:
Within this repository, you will find the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm for binary and multi-class classification tasks. SVMs are well-suited for this project due to their ability to handle complex decision boundaries and perform exceptionally well in high-dimensional spaces.

Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding of the quality grades to prepare the dataset for training.
2. **SVM Classifier**: The core of the project is the implementation of the SVM classifier. The classifier is trained on the mango dataset to predict the quality grade accurately.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The project employs various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the SVM classifier's performance in classifying mangoes into quality grades.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizations, such as decision boundaries and confusion matrices, are provided to gain insights into the SVM model's performance.
5. **Model Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, the repository may include code and instructions for deploying the trained SVM model for real-world quality assessment.

Getting Started:
